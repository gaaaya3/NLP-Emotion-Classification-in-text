Suitability of Models for Emotion Classification:
Naive Bayes: This model is effective for text classification due to its simplicity and efficiency with high-dimensional data like text.
Support Vector Machine: SVM is powerful for classification tasks as it finds the optimal hyperplane that separates classes with maximum margin, making it suitable for distinguishing between different emotions effectively.
